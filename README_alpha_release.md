# Block Brawl Alpha Release

**aPplication Crafting Masters**  
Francisco (Paco) Camacho, Cammie Olsgard, Malcolm La Force

## Usage instructions

Fairly self-explanatory. Most buttons, including the profile button in the upper-right corner of the main menu, will take you to another screen according to the storyboard that we previously submitted. We've included the storyboard in PDF form as a reference point for navigation.

## Known bugs

While not bugs per se, the UI is not yet fully polished and is very much subject to change. We are aware of any less-than-pretty screens and will be working to improve them. It is currently a proof-of-concept (as this release is generally supposed to be).

## Desired areas of feedback

- UI suggestions: if you have ideas for how to lay things out more intuitively, or generally "better", feel free to suggest improvements.
- Additional features: If there's something that is really screaming to be there but isn't.
- Anything else.

Thanks!
