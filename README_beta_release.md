**aPplication Crafting Masters**  
Francisco (Paco) Camacho, Cammie Olsgard, Malcolm La Force

## Usage instructions

The gameplay window has a simple mechanism for dragging the block around the screen.

## Known bugs

Obviously, functionality is missing, but there should not be any app-crashing or crazy bugs. Please let us know if there are.

## Desired areas of feedback

We don't have a specific area of feedback that we're looking for, so anything goes here.

## Alpha release feedback

We received a lot of feedback saying that we should add a top bar with a back button, so that has been done. We also received comments about nonfunctional checkboxes, which was also fixed.

Thank you!
